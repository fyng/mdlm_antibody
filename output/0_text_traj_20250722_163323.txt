Final Text Sample:
<|endoftext|> next week. It might be interesting to watch him take a mask.    It’s been cold, hurt that he doesn’t know his shoulder, but 5’9’s long. He’s not attached to the postgame equipment yet so he doesn’t really need to retrieve it.    “You probably screws that are loose in the game,” Starchman said. “You don’t mean to mess, dangerous things, so we’re good, and I think his shoulder will be OK, even if it comes too late, which is not that he’ll know what to do.”    He hasn’t left the team since round 9, 2011, so not many people hit a patch hole around the same time.    “He lost his brother (and before that), he lost his brother, so it’s a health-related issue,” Chiarelli said of Nichumkin, who joined the team on Friday evening.    “It’s a very emotional thing, but we can also say lots of love to him because he’s not sick. He’s got some sorted stuff past the hard learning and mistakes. ‘We didn’t always skate’ – literally we need the set-piece work; he’s done better than any one else.”    This is about making in the NHL and now in a NHL you can’t leave without going C-Train.    “It’s going to be an adjustment,” said Peter McClement, junior-league coach and former Canadian Olympic champion. When he moves on to the game, forget hockey.    “I think he’ll take that group with him, because he’s good at the things that you take on. Sometimes it can be hard and it’s easy to get a face. They’re the toughest things in life. He’s calm and composed. That’s about learning, learn how to be nimble, adjust to tough times.”    Those ought to be quite a couple lessons. Don’t think he’ll just stick with his hometown team – he’s be approaching 44 years old at the end of the year and has been with other teams since he turned 18. Look at his family. It’s very tough and you got in your life to adjust when you’re young.    While last season, Nichumkin won the Norris Trophy (in overtime with the Washington Capitals), Therrien (the Montreal Canadiens) said of Nichumkin, “The kid doesn’t deserve being that win. He’s ‘nice to have.’    “That’s a tough comment,” added Nichumkin. “He’s a little kid at 26, (and the coaches) need to take him a step. There’s no other approach that he’s taken so far, and from it we are going to play to him Sedins and Andrew. We’re going to bring the best out of it. We won’t call it the first ones. We’re going to get to the younger guys in the game.”    As with last year’s season, the more troublesome is that he’ll play for the Capitals now. But perhaps he’ll face Alex Paroli eventually or Jesse Friberg – when he’s not eating up the Memorial Cup or for a Memorial Trophy game.    “It’s some amazing games, and in many games the fans weren’t able to get a Cup and he’s losing the big games to him,” Yzerman said.    One final addition, Nichum could miss the Cup (in Russian settlement), so Starcherman and Andy Bump will be going home again to something that’s already not having much fun. It’s all about going to Canada because it can look exciting, and gets get involved, savor the battles in the city.    “If you watch the Pacifics in Holland and New Jersey, he’s very involved,” Bauer said.    He got to watch some of his (sick) prospects (on Thursday) play at Halbron Arena of the Czech Republic.    “That was exciting,” Bump said, referring to a 2-1 loss at Benham Arena there.
